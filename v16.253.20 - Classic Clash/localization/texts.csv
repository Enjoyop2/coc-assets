"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_PARTY_WIZARD","The distant echo of a kick snare or high hat can only mean one thing; the Party Wizard is making his grand entrance. Dropping phat beats and massive fireballs, he's the soul of post-battle celebrations."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_PEKKA","Is P.E.K.K.A a knight? A samurai? A robot? No one knows! P.E.K.K.A´s armor absorbs even the mightiest of blows."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_PEKKA_SHORT","Massively armored with a mightily brutal sword."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_PUMPKIN_BARBARIAN","Who would've thought that pumpkins make for good makeshift armor? The pumpkin helmets provide these regular Barbarians some extra hitpoints until they get destroyed."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_RAGED_BARBARIAN","Why is he so angry, speedy and vicious? Nobody's brave enough to ask. Maybe it's because he can't find his sword?"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_RAGED_BARBARIAN_SHORT","More speed, more rage, more drool!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_RAID_CART","Another Cannon on wheels?! It might lack the element of surprise, but makes up for it with lots of bulk, added firepower and an escort of rowdy Barbarians!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_RAM_RIDER","She may not know the RAMifications of defeat as this Gingerbread Ram Rider is one tough cookie. This dessert duo is the best combination since Oreo and Juliet and makes Walls crumble like overbaked biscuits."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_RIDER","Having tamed the fierce leaping Hog, the Hog Rider punishes those who hide behind their puny Walls! Fueled by Dark Elixir, these warriors have never known defeat!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_RIDER_SHORT","Leaps over Walls for up close hammer time with defenses."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_ROCKET_BALLOONS","When terrain is working against you, a swarm of Rocket Balloons can probably get the job done... if their boosters don't run out first."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIDE_THROWER","This big budding sportsman throws a heavy bouncing ball at the nearest Building. Then he moves on to the typical Giant smashing!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_CART","A Cannon on wheels?! Bet they won't see that coming! Tons of fire-power, but not that sturdy!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_CARRIER","The Siege Barracks parachutes down gracefully to first release a menagerie of P.E.K.K.As and Wizards and then the Clan Castle troops. How they all managed to squeeze inside is a mystery not really worth investigating."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_CARRIER_SHORT","Spawns Wizards and a P.E.K.K.A to do its dirty work."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_CATAPULT","This little charmer flings bundles of Fire Spirits that both hit hard and leave behind a burning mess. Its long range helps it stay out of trouble, but beware of longer range defenses and traps! Immune to spell effects."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_CATAPULT_SHORT","Burn bases down to the ground from afar."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_FLYER","The Battle Blimp bypasses ground-based obstacles and delivers your Clan Castle troops directly into the heart of the enemy Village, all while dropping bombs along the way. However, its thin hide makes it easier to shoot down. Immune to Spell effects."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_FLYER_SHORT","Bombs its way straight to the Town Hall."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_INVISIBLE","WIP Moves toward the TH and has an invisibility aura to hide your troops."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_INVISIBLE_FLYING","WIP Flying drone that follows your troops with the GW AI and has an invisibility aura."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_LOG_LAUNCHER","While Log Launcher certainly isn't the fastest or the sturdiest, it is definitely among the meanest. This trunk-throwing contraption pummels everything in front of it with endless logs to open up a path to the enemy Town Hall. Immune to spell effects."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_LOG_LAUNCHER_SHORT","Relentlessly lobs log after log."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_RAM","The Wall Wrecker exists for two simple purposes: to smash through anything that it comes across and to deliver the Clan Castle Troops straight to the heart of the Village. Built from heavy duty materials, it can take a pummeling before breaking down. Immune to Spell effects."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_RAM_SHORT","Breaks a path right through to the Town Hall."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SIEGE_MACHINE_TROOP_CATAPULT","WIP Flings your Siege Machine troops"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SKELETON","This undead creature poses little threat by itself. But it never fights alone, since the Witch can summon an endless horde of Skeletons against your enemy!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SKELETON2","This undead creature poses little threat by itself. But it never fights alone, since the Drop Ship can throw an endless horde of Skeletons at your enemies!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SKELETON3","This undead creature poses little threat by itself. But it never fights alone, since there's a whole gang of them battling together!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SKELETON_BARREL","Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, just Harry, Larry, Terry and a dozen friends, heading for the nearest building in a barrel of bones!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SKELETON_BARRELS","Did someone say Barrel Parade? It's a Skeleton party in the sky, until all the balloons pop... then it's a Skeleton party on the ground!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SKELETON_GLIDER","It's hard to get past Walls as a lowly Skeleton. But bones and gliders are light enough to easily soar over them!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SKELETON_GOLEM_WITCH","This undead creature poses little threat by itself. But it never fights alone, since the Witch Golem can summon an endless horde of Skeletons against your enemy!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SNEAKY_ARCHER","Cloaked under cover of moonlight, Archers can take out targets before ever being seen. Their weakness? Overconfidence."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SNEAKY_ARCHERS","A squad of stealthy Archers is a surefire way to take out important targets. Until they get revealed, that is."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SNEAKY_ARCHER_SHORT","What´s better than sniping defenses? Being invisible while you do it."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SPEAR_GOBLIN","Who thought it was a good idea to teach Goblins how to throw spears? Where do all the spears come from? No matter, they make a great deterrent for both ground and air attackers."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SUPER_BARBARIANS","For any urgent pummeling needs, you can always rely on a gang of Super Barbarians. They're best fresh after being deployed, but maintain a good work ethic even after calming down."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SUPER_CHARGED_PEKKA","Unstable energy radiates from this powerful suit of dark armor, waiting to be unleashed!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SUPER_CHARGED_PEKKA_SHORT","This overpowered P.E.K.K.A has a terrifying stomp."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SUPER_GIANTS","A pair of Super Giants are a true multi-tool: beefy, great at smashing defenses, but also talented at breaking through Walls, when needed!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SUPER_MINION","Super Minion's big forehead isn't just for show: sniping enemy defenses from a safe distance is simply a brainy move! Especially when you've grown too big to avoid Seeking Air Mines."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_SUPER_WIZARDS","Did you know a group of Super Wizards is called an \qego\q? Great at blasting away buildings placed close together, but not as tough as they'd like to think!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_TOXIC_MINION","Attacks targets from a distance, glows in the dark, and is a maniac on the dance floor."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_TOXIC_MINION_SHORT","Glowing green gargoyles give gratuitous gifts."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_TREANT","This earth warrior is so in tune with nature she doesn't need to walk herself. Riding into battle on top a tough tree root which can smash through Walls and slam defenses into dust."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_TREANT_SHORT","Her tough tree root smashes Walls and defenses into dust."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_VALKYRIE","A master of the two-handed axe, this glorious warrior runs between nearby buildings and can shred several troops or buildings at once with her whirlwind blow!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_VALKYRIE_SHORT","This whirling warrior's axe reduces buildings to rubble."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_WALLBREAKER","Nothing warms a Wall Breaker's cold and undead heart like blowing up Walls. A squad of them will make way for your ground units, and they will do it with a BANG!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_WALLBREAKER_SHORT","Helps the rest of your Army by blowing holes in Walls."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_WARLOCK","The Witch never fights alone, constantly raising dead warriors from past battles to lead her attacks. Upgraded Witches raise more skeletons at a time."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_WARLOCK_SHORT","Summon Skeletons with style!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_WATER_DRAGON","The Year of the Azure Dragon represents strength and power, and this majestic wyrm embodies both. As a harbinger of spring and the coming rainfall, may Azure Dragon rain victory upon your battlefield. With its high hit points and piercing splash projectile that also deals damage behind its initial target, this mighty unit will definitely make sure your battles don't... drag on."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_WIZARD","The Wizard is a terrifying presence on the battlefield. Pair him up with some of his fellows and cast concentrated blasts of destruction on anything, land or sky!"
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_WIZARD2","This Legendary wizard slows down enemy defenses with destructive shards of ice!\n\nOnly available for a limited time."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_WIZARD_SHORT","No wand needed for fireball after fireball."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_YETI","This heavy-hitting furry fellow digs cold weather and his Yetimite buddies. Hurt him, and you'll make the Yetimites real angry."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_YETIMITE","These little guys are super cuddly, but get very angsty when their big friend gets hurt. Hurt him enough, and they will swarm the nearest defense with a terrible purposefulness."
"TID_CHARACTER_INFO_YETI_SHORT","A furry fellow with ferocious little friends."
"TID_CHARACTER_ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED","You already own this Equipment!"

Furthermore, if you prefer to not use your Siege Machine, you can still deploy your Clan Castle reinforcements the old fashioned way by toggling to the Clan Castle banner in the troop bar. Don´t forget to request Clan Castle troops from your Clan mates! Having an empty Clan Castle means your Siege Machines will be empty as well. There is no wrong choice in which Siege Machine you choose. Ultimately, it´s up to you to decide which one is the right one that complements your Clan Castle troop combination!"

Over the next seven days, your clan will war with each of the other clans to determine who's the best in your group! Clans that do well can get promoted to the next higher league tier while the bottom performing clans will get dropped to the next tier below your current one.\n\nWhen a battle week starts, your clan will first enter into preparation period for your first war day. During the preparation day you can choose the participants for the next war from everyone who signed up. After 24 hours have passed, the first war day will begin. Simultaneously, preparations for the second war day will also begin!"

The Leaderboard displays the status of your Clan's performance throughout the Battle Week and is based on the total number of Stars earned. Your clan earns an additional 10 Stars for each won war.

It is a monthly league that puts your clan against seven others to determine which is the best. You will fight against the seven other clans in seven wars over seven days. At the end, clans that have earned the most stars are promoted to higher leagues while others stay or are demoted. Next month you will resume where you left off. The higher you can get, the more rewards and glory you can earn. Keep climbing upwards with your clan and you may eventually become the best in the world!"

Once seven other Clans from your league tier have been found, preparation for the first round will begin immediately!<cFCE27F>\n\nMy Clan isn't very strong. Should we participate?</c>\n\nYes!
